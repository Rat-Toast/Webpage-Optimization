# Webpage-Optimization
In this Project I aimed to rafactor the code to include smeantic elemnts for easier readability, such as replacing <div> elements with more descriptive elements.

As someone new to coding this code refactor proved to be a real challenge, as I  was removing the non-semantic elements, I also had to research the Semantic elements I was inserting to make sure I was using the right elements. I also had to ensure the coding was easily readable if someone else were to refactor the code to further optimize the webpage.

I used html for the code and css for the styling as this project was an optimization excersize therefore there wasnt a need for any additional technologies.

As I progress in my coding skills, I would like to further optimize the webpage fit all screen types, tablet, mobile, etc.

Here is the refrence code I used for this project:
